# ALBundyInventoryManagement
The project focuses on inventory management for Al Bundy's shoe store using confidence intervals. The data is segmented based on shoe size, country, and gender.


Game Plan:

Part 1 [USA]:

1. Analyze the sales data for the last 12 months.
2. Focus on men's shoes as the problem is identical for this segment.
3. Concentrate on sales data from the USA.

Using t-statistics, we calculate the confidence intervals. The upper bound of the confidence interval represents the maximum number of pairs of shoes needed in inventory.


Part 2 [Germany]:

-The project also examines how one shop outperforms the other in terms of sales.
-here we are dealing with independent samples, the population variance is unknown but assumed to be equal,

Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the two shoe shops are well-balanced in terms of sales. This balance allows for the possibility of bundling them together, sharing the same warehouse for more efficient inventory management.
